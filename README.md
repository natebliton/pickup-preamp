# pickup-preamp
KiCAD project for violin/viola piezo project

I primarily use a Kremona pickup for my viola, and initially designed a preamp to work with that.

I also have a backup instrument that instead has a fishman pickup that requires a "high impedance preamp". So, the next step is to either make another preamp that works for that, or to modify the initial design in order to have adjustable input impedance (hopefully the latter).
